# Apple Sign-In Setup Guide

## ✅ Code Implementation Complete

The Apple Sign-In integration is fully implemented in your iOS app. Here's what's been added:

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `FirebaseManager.swift` - Added `signInWithApple()` method with nonce generation
- ✅ `AuthenticationView.swift` - Implemented Apple Sign-In flow with proper coordinator
- ✅ Framework imports added - AuthenticationServices and CryptoKit

## 🔧 Required Setup Steps

### Step 1: Enable Sign in with Apple Capability
1. Open your project in **Xcode**
2. Select your **project file** in the navigator
3. Select your **target** (Spark)
4. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
5. Click **+ Capability**
6. Add **Sign in with Apple**

### Step 2: Configure in Apple Developer Portal
1. Go to **https://developer.apple.com**
2. Navigate to **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**
3. Select your app's **identifier**
4. Enable **Sign In with Apple** capability
5. **Save** changes

### Step 3: Enable Apple Sign-In in Firebase Console
1. Go to **https://console.firebase.google.com**
2. Select your **spark-42212** project
3. Go to **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**
4. Click **Apple** and **Enable** it
5. **Save** the changes

### Step 4: Configure App ID (if needed)
1. In Xcode → **Project Settings** → **General**
2. Ensure **Bundle Identifier** matches Firebase: `com.muckstack.spark`
3. Make sure **Team** is selected for code signing

## 🧪 Testing Apple Sign-In

After setup:
1. **Build and run** on a real device or simulator
2. **Tap "Continue with Apple"**
3. **Face ID/Touch ID** prompt appears (on device)
4. **Authenticate** with biometrics or passcode
5. **Choose** to share or hide email
6. **App authenticates** and shows main interface

## 🎯 What Happens When It Works:

1. User taps **"Continue with Apple"**
2. **Apple Sign-In sheet** appears
3. User **authenticates** with Face ID/Touch ID
4. User chooses **email sharing** preference
5. **Firebase authenticates** the user
6. **Analytics tracks** `auth_apple_signin_success`
7. **App shows** main note-taking interface

## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### "Sign in with Apple errored" Alert:
- Check **Sign in with Apple** capability is added in Xcode
- Verify **Bundle ID** matches in all locations
- Ensure **Apple Sign-In** is enabled in Firebase Console
- Check you're **signed in to iCloud** on simulator/device

### No Apple Sign-In Sheet:
- Verify **Team** is selected in Xcode signing
- Check **Provisioning Profile** includes Sign in with Apple
- Ensure running on **iOS 13.0+**
- Try **Clean Build Folder** (Shift+Cmd+K)

### Authentication Fails:
- Check **Firebase Apple provider** is enabled
- Verify **nonce** is being generated correctly
- Ensure **Internet connection** is working
- Check **Firebase project** is correctly configured

## ✨ Features Included:

- ✅ **Secure authentication** with biometrics
- ✅ **Privacy-focused** - users can hide email
- ✅ **Automatic account creation** on first sign-in
- ✅ **Name retrieval** (if user shares it)
- ✅ **Nonce validation** for security
- ✅ **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- ✅ **Analytics tracking** for sign-in events
- ✅ **Seamless integration** with existing auth flow

## 💡 Next Steps:

1. **Add Sign in with Apple capability** in Xcode
2. **Enable Apple provider** in Firebase Console  
3. **Test on real device** for best experience
4. **Submit for App Store review** with Sign in with Apple

## 📱 App Store Requirements:

If you offer **any** third-party sign-in (Google), Apple **requires** Sign in with Apple as an option. Make sure it's:
- **Prominently displayed** (same size/position)
- **Works correctly** before submission
- **Follows Apple's design guidelines**

The implementation is production-ready once the capabilities are configured! 🚀
