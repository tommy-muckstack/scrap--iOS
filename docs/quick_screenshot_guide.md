## ðŸ“± Next Steps for Complete Screenshot Set

### Step 1: Add Sample Content
In the app, add these notes by typing them in:

**Note 1:**
Title: `Self-Exploration and Identity Discovery`
Content: `Who am I really beneath all the roles I play? This question has been echoing in my mind lately. I realize I've been so focused on meeting others' expectations that I've lost touch with my authentic self.`

**Note 2:**
Title: `Morning Meditation Insights`
Content: `During today's 20-minute sit, I noticed how my mind immediately goes to my to-do list. But underneath that mental chatter, there's a stillness that feels like home.`

**Note 3:**
Title: `Creative Flow State`  
Content: `There's something magical about those moments when time disappears and the work just flows through you.`

### Step 2: Capture Screenshots

After adding the notes, capture these screenshots:

```bash
# 1. Main screen with notes
xcrun simctl io "2B4B21E3-B3C7-464C-97D1-DD7BC867C1B7" screenshot "Screenshots/02-main-with-notes.png"

# 2. After tapping on first note (note editing view - now without "Edit Note" header!)
xcrun simctl io "2B4B21E3-B3C7-464C-97D1-DD7BC867C1B7" screenshot "Screenshots/03-note-editing-clean.png"

# 3. Back to main, then tap microphone for voice recording
xcrun simctl io "2B4B21E3-B3C7-464C-97D1-DD7BC867C1B7" screenshot "Screenshots/04-voice-recording.png"

# 4. Scroll down and tap "My Account"
xcrun simctl io "2B4B21E3-B3C7-464C-97D1-DD7BC867C1B7" screenshot "Screenshots/05-account-drawer.png"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Pro Tip
The note editing screenshot will now show the clean interface without the "Edit Note" header - much better for App Store presentation!
